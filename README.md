## Hi! My name's Aradhya (Some people also call me Eddy) ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Software Engineering at Western University and Business at Ivey <br/>
ðŸ’¼ Have done SWE internships at General Dynamics, Google, and a few startups. Most recently spent a summer doing consulting at McKinsey & Co. (coding less than usual) <br/>
ðŸ™Œ The stuff I do here matters, but it also doesn't. Don't take it too seriously, just seriously enough <br/>
