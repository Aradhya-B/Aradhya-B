🎓 Software Engineering at Western University and Business at Ivey <br/>
💼 Have done internships at General Dynamics, Google, and a few startups. Currently at McKinsey & Co. (coding less than usual) <br/>
🙌 The stuff I do here matters, but it also doesn't. Don't take it too seriously, just seriously enough <br/>
